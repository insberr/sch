# schedule-script

"Schedule script is a simple script to schedule a script to run at a specific time." -GitHub CoPilot

Schedule Script is a scripting language developed for [Schedule Personalizer](https://github.com/insberr/schedule-personalizer). It was created because why the heck not and also because I did not want to write the config in JSON or TypeScript. Something custom would make some things way easier to work with.

That aside. HFGL.
